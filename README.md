This project uses linear regression to determine whether an e-commerce company should focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. The company sells clothing online and also has in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The data for this project includes information on the number of orders placed on the mobile app, the number of orders placed on the website, and the number of in-store style and clothing advice sessions. The linear regression model was used to predict the number of orders placed on the mobile app and the number of orders placed on the website. The results of the model were then used to determine which platform the company should focus their efforts on.
